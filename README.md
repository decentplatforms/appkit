# appkit

appkit is a collection of helpful modules for building applications in Go.

## Tools

- `tracy`: Application logging

## Installation and Usage

Most Go projects contain one module in the root directory of the repository. Since appkit doesn't, version control with `go get` looks a little different. To get a project, do `go get github.com/decentplatforms/appkit/[project]`. To get a specific version, use version tag `[project]/vX.Y.Z`.
